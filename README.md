# 2d-cellular-automata
C implemenatation of a 2D cellular automaton. WIP.
Main idea is to implement a Rule 110.
## Cool stuff about Rule 110
Rule 110 is Turing complete [Reference], meaning it can compute anything can be computed, provided the algorithm is properly encoded to be recognized by the CA.
A good example is Regular Expression recognition [Reference].
